Pebbleash
=========

The word Pebbleash is a portmanteau of Pebble and leash. Pebble is a highly popular smartwatch and Pebbleash is a companion app for it. If turned on, it monitors the strength of connection between the iDevice and the Pebble smartwatch, and notifies the Pebble smartwatch if the distance, as indicated by the strength of connection, between them is far enough.
